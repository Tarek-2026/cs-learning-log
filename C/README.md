# 🧠 C Programming Projects

This folder contains beginner-level programs written in C as part of my CS learning log. These exercises focus on logic building, user input handling, and core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions.

## 🔹 Programs

### 1. `01-guessing-game.c`
A simple game where the user has 3 attempts to guess a predefined secret number.

### 2. `02-meaw-function.c`
Asks the user how many times to print "meaw" using a custom function and `do-while` loop validation.

### 3. `03-basic-calculator.c`
A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It validates division by zero and invalid operators.

### 4. `04-coin-change.c`
Implements a greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum number of U.S. coins (1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢) needed to make change.

### 5. `05-credit.c`
Validates credit card numbers using **Luhn's Algorithm** and determines the card type (Visa, MasterCard, American Express) based on number structure.

### 6. 06-Scrabble Word Scorer 


A simple C program that simulates a 2-player Scrabble-style word scoring game.  
Each letter has a point value. The player with the higher total score wins.

## What I Learned
- Using functions and arrays
- Handling strings in C
- Input/output basics
- `ctype.h` usage (`tolower`, `isalpha`)
- Basic scoring logic

## How to Run
Compile and run with:
```bash
gcc scrabble.c -o scrabble
./scrabble

These programs reflect my step-by-step learning of core C concepts. More to come as I progress through CS50 and beyond!
