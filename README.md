# 👨‍💻 CS Learning Log

Hi, I'm Tarek, and this is my personal log of learning Computer Science and Web Development.

I'm starting my journey with C programming and frontend development (HTML, CSS, and later JavaScript). I'm not aiming to stop at frontend — it's just a practical first step. It helps me build real projects, take on freelance work early, and create a strong foundation before diving deeper into more advanced areas of tech.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving
- Start with frontend development to build projects and freelance-ready skills
- Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-world web development
- Explore deeper CS topics like data structures, algorithms, and backend development
- Use this repo to track progress and share my learning in public
